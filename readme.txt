== Description ==
Allows you to add/edit/attach/un-attach/sort the files attached to your WordPress posts all from the post editor.  Integrates seamlessly with WordPress using the default WordPress attachments type and no configuration needed to add WP Better Attachments to custom post types.

Note: As of now WPBA only works with images I hope to add at least attach and un-attach functionality to all other types in the coming weeks.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `wp-github-recent-commit` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to any page/post/custom post type and start editing your attachments with ease. 
4. Use the add attachments button to add new attachments, WordPress<3.5 does not have multi select capabilities.

6. Click the Un-attach link to un-attach the file from your post.
